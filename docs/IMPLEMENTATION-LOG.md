# IMPLEMENTATION LOG — reliability, central administration, practical usability

Durable checkpoint for the owner's brief. **Read this first after any context
reset.** It records what is done, what was decided and why, what was measured,
and what the next executable step is.

| | |
|---|---|
| Baseline reviewed | `dd3336c` (`v1.0.5`) — the published release |
| Branch | `feature/admin-hardening` (nothing force-pushed; no release tag moved) |
| Platform used for work | macOS 26.x, Python 3.9.6 (LibreSSL), venv in `.venv/` |
| Appliance target | Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi OS Lite, Python 3.13.5, nginx 1.22 |
| Deployment status | **not deployed** — code, config and tests only |
| Hardware tests | **none performed** (no browser/phone in this environment) |

## 1. Status against the brief

| § | Area | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | Public read-only vs administrator | **partly done** — split exists; public board/file write paths are still anonymous (they move behind the admin switch in a later stage) |
| 4 | Central accounts, bootstrap, forced change, multi-admin | **stage 2 complete and tested** |
| 5 | Management transport, backend restriction, identities | **transport done** (8443 origin, 8444 loopback, :80 404); service-identity split and Kalibre/Kiwix route blocking **not done** |
| 6 | File storage, upload safety, import workflow | not started (defects reproduced, see §3) |
| 7 | Board errors and housekeeping | error page **fixed**; moderation not started |
| 8 | Bounded search | reproduced, not fixed |
| 9 | Truthful downloads/readiness/health | not started |
| 10 | Network loss after boot | not started |
| 11 | Backup / offline recovery kit | not started |
| 12 | Emergency content review | not started |
| 13 | Essentials pack, QR, accessibility, household page | not started |
| 14 | Sequence | stage 1–2 done, stage 3 next |
| 15 | Acceptance tests | 42 tests for stages 1–2; the rest are unwritten by construction |

## 2. What changed in stage 2

New files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pi/api/ark_db.py` | one connection policy, numbered migrations, audit helper, install marker |
| `pi/api/ark_security.py` | scrypt hashing, password policy, opaque sessions, CSRF, throttling |
| `pi/api/ark_admin.py` | `/admin` routes: overview, sign-in, forced setup, accounts, audit |
| `pi/api/ark_recover.py` | root-only recovery logic (called through the wrapper) |
| `pi/bin/ark-tls-cert` | creates/renews the box's own certificate, prints the fingerprint |
| `pi/bin/ark-admin-recover` | `0700 root:root` wrapper; the only web-inaccessible way back in |
| `pi/nginx/ark-admin.conf` | `:8443` management origin + `:8444` loopback setup listener |
| `pi/steps/65-admin.sh` | installs the above and proves each door (404/403/TLS-only) |
| `pi/portal/assets/ark-admin.css` | admin-only styling (48 px targets, focus rings, print-safe) |
| `tests/*` | 42 tests, throwaway databases, `pytest` |

Modified: `pi/api/main.py` (mounts the router, shared DB layer, atoms for the
error page), `pi/nginx/ark.conf` (`/admin` → 404 on :80), `pi/steps/60-portal.sh`
(copies the new modules, checks the 404), `pi/install-ark.sh` (adds the step),
`README.md`, `.gitignore`, `pytest.ini`.

## 3. Defects reproduced against the checkout (evidence, not hearsay)

| Defect | Where | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `error_page()` wrapped an `HTMLResponse` inside another → `AttributeError`, HTTP 500 on an invalid board post | `main.py` (pre-fix) | `tests/test_public.py::test_invalid_board_post_returns_400_not_500` now asserts a 400; before the fix the same call raised `AttributeError: 'HTMLResponse' object has no attribute 'encode'` |
| Upload naming collides: second upload gets `YYYYmmdd-HHMM-name`, the third **overwrites** it inside the same minute | `main.py` `files_post` | read: `stamp` has minute resolution, `tmp.replace(target)` is unconditional. Not yet fixed (stage 3) |
| `search_library()` "12 s deadline" drains: leaving `as_completed(timeout=…)` waits for the executor context manager to join every worker, and 20 collections ÷ 6 workers × 9 s per source is far past the budget | `main.py` | read; no test yet (stage 4) |
| nginx allows 4 GiB bodies while the API rejects at 2 GiB | `ark.conf` `client_max_body_size 4g` vs `MAX_UPLOAD` | read; alignment belongs with the storage rework |
| `kiwix-serve` listens on `*:8081`, bypassing the proxy | live Pi `ss -ltnH` | `*:8081` observed; loopback-only change is stage 3/5 work |
| Database connections never closed (`with db() as conn` is a transaction, not a close) | `main.py` | replaced by `ark_db.read()` / `ark_db.tx()` in this stage |
| README says `/srv/ark/zim-pause`; the downloader reads `/etc/ark/zim-pause` | `README.md` vs `pi/bin/ark-zim-download:21` | fixed in this stage; profile name `min` → `mini` fixed too |

## 4. Decision log

Numbered so later stages can cite them. Change one only with a reason written
here.

**D1 — scrypt (stdlib), not Argon2id.** The brief allows either. `hashlib.scrypt`
needs no new dependency on the appliance (OpenSSL 3 is already there), while
`argon2-cffi` adds a compiled wheel to a box that may be rebuilt offline.
Parameters `n=2^15, r=8, p=1` cost 32 MiB and are recorded inside each hash, so
they can be raised later without invalidating accounts (`needs_rehash` +
rehash-on-sign-in already handle the migration path).

**D2 — one extra code path, for the developer machine only.** Apple's Python
links LibreSSL, which has no `hashlib.scrypt`, so the suite could not hash
anything. `pi/api/ark_security.py` falls back to the `cryptography` package's
scrypt when the stdlib one is missing. The Pi never takes that branch, and
`tests/test_db.py::test_hashes_from_the_pi_verify_here` pins a digest produced
by the Pi's `hashlib` and verifies it on the Mac, so the two cannot silently
diverge. The fallback is *scrypt with the same parameters*, never a weaker
scheme.

**D3 — the marker file is the memory of "configured".** `ark.installed` lives
next to the database but outside it, so deleting the database cannot resurrect
the public bootstrap password: the box reports *recovery-required* and points at
`ark-admin-recover`.

**D4 — the first claim needs the loopback listener.** `:8444` is bound to
`127.0.0.1`, reachable through `ssh -L`. nginx sets `X-ARK-Setup-Channel:
loopback` there and *blanks that header* on `:8443`; the API additionally
requires the peer address to be loopback. A caller-supplied header alone can
never open that door (tested).

**D5 — separate origin, shared process.** Admin routes live on the same
FastAPI app but only nginx's TLS listener proxies them; `:80` answers 404 for
`/admin`. Cookies are `Path=/admin`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`, and no
`Domain`, so an XSS on the reading pages cannot ride the admin cookie, and a
cross-site POST cannot attach it.

**D6 — sessions do not survive a restart.** On start the app bumps a `session_epoch`
and deletes session rows. Cost: everyone signs in once after a reboot. Benefit:
a stolen cookie cannot outlive a restart, and a jumped clock cannot extend a
session indefinitely.

**D7 — one role.** "Administrator" only. The brief explicitly forbids an
unnecessary hierarchy; every account can do everything, and the last-admin rule
keeps the box reachable.

**D8 — no JavaScript in the admin area.** Forms, links and `<details>` only.
Progressive enhancement can come later for long jobs, not for control paths.

**D9 — 0700 root:root recovery, run as `pi`.** The wrapper is root-only but
executes the Python as the portal user, so the SQLite WAL files stay owned by
`pi` and the running service keeps working.

**D10 — keep `pi` as the service user for now.** Splitting service identities
(§5 of the brief) touches file ownership across `drop/`, `api/data` and the
venvs and belongs with the upload rework; doing it now would risk the working
library for no user-visible gain.

**D11 — tests live in `tests/`, outside `pi/`.** They need fastapi/httpx/pytest,
which the appliance does not install. `tests/requirements.txt` documents the
extra packages, and the suite uses only temporary directories.

---

## 5. Test evidence

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest
..........................................                               [100%]
42 passed
```

Environment: macOS, Python 3.9.6, fastapi/uvicorn/httpx/pytest from
`tests/requirements.txt`, scrypt via the `cryptography` fallback.
Database: a fresh `tmp_path` per test; the live library is never opened.

Cross-implementation check, run on the appliance:

```
$ ssh pi@ark.local python3 -c 'hashlib.scrypt(b"cross-check passphrase", salt=b"\0"*16, n=1<<15, r=8, p=1, dklen=32)'
1e8c96673daca25043c299e0c4b507211a24f3b7622a08abda33fc7563e5b8be
```
…and the same value is the one embedded in `tests/test_db.py`, where it is
verified through the Mac's fallback.

---

## 6. Next executable step

Stage 3, in this order (each with a test before the code):

1. **Uploads**: unique internal IDs + safe display names; exclusive temp files
   outside public paths; stream with a size cap enforced *before* spooling
   (align nginx `client_max_body_size` with the app's limit); atomic finalise;
   quota and free-space reserve; abandoned-temp reconciliation.
2. **Imports**: exclude `done/`, stable per-file states, content hashes,
   idempotent rescans, keep the File Box link valid after import.
3. **Board**: pinned/resolved/hidden states, pagination, moderation routes
   behind the new session (the auth groundwork is already in place).

Definition of done for each: a failing test first, then the fix, then
`pytest` green, then a checkpoint line here.

Rules that still apply: never force-push, never move `v1.0.5`, keep the public
reading path working at every commit, do not deploy or reboot the live box
without the owner's explicit go-ahead.
